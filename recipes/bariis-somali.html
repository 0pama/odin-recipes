    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Anjero is a staple in Somali cuisine. It is a fermented, pancake-like bread used in both sweeter breakfast dishes and savory meals</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 cup white corn flour </li>
            <li>
            ½ cup sorghum flour </li>
            <li>
            1 Tbsp Instant dry yeast </li>
            <li>
            4 cups self-raising flour </li>
            <li>
            ¼ cup sugar </li>
            <li>
            1 tsp salt </li>
            <li>
            4 cups lukewarm water </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the white corn meal, sorghum flour, yeast, and half of the water, making sure it is properly combined. Leave for one hour.</li>
        <li>After one hour, add in the self-rising flour and sugar, then slowly start adding the remaining water as you mix to get a smooth, lump-less texture for your batter.</li>
        <li>The key to achieving the classic anjero taste is fermentation. The mix should rest in a warm place to allow the fermentation to take place. The minimum time would be a few hours but to achieve a more authentic, sour anjero taste, you can let the batter ferment for up to two days. For this recipe, you can let the batter ferment overnight.</li>
        <li>In a non-stick frying pan on medium heat, ladle the batter mix into the pan according to preferred portion size, making sure that the batter spreads fully across the surface of the pan.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and cook for a few minutes per portion. The desired color is a golden brown, and the texture should be spongy with no liquid remaining.</li>
        <li>Plate the pancake and continue the process until each person has around 3 pancakes.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate leftover batter and use it for lunch or for tomorrows breakfast.</li>
    </ol>
